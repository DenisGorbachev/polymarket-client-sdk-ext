# Implement Archive for BookSide

## Files

* src/types/book_side.rs
* src/types/amount.rs
* src/types/rkyv_decimal.rs

## Tasks

* Add derive Archive from `rkyv` to BookSide
* Fix the error by using RkyvDecimal
  * Try to do it in an elegant way with minimal code (research how to do it)

## Notes

* I have already enabled IndexMap support feature for rkyv
